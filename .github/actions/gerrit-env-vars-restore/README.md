# üõ†Ô∏è Gerrit Environment Variables Restore

This GitHub Action restores Gerrit environment variables from a checkpoint artifact that was previously saved. It's designed to work in multi-job workflows where Gerrit-related data needs to be passed between jobs.

## Overview

The action downloads a `vpp-gerrit-vars` artifact from a workflow run and extracts the stored Gerrit environment variables, making them available for subsequent workflow steps.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Restore Gerrit Environment Variables
  uses: fdio/.github/.github/actions/gerrit-env-vars-restore@main
  with:
    TUI_LINE: "*******************************************************************"
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `TUI_LINE` | Delimiter line for TUI output formatting | No | `"*******************************************************************"` |

## Environment Variables Restored

This action restores the following Gerrit-related environment variables:

- `GERRIT_BRANCH` - The target branch for the Gerrit change
- `GERRIT_CHANGE_ID` - Unique identifier for the Gerrit change
- `GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER` - Numeric identifier for the Gerrit change
- `GERRIT_CHANGE_URL` - Direct URL to the Gerrit change
- `GERRIT_EVENT_TYPE` - Type of Gerrit event that triggered the workflow
- `GERRIT_PATCHSET_NUMBER` - Current patchset number
- `GERRIT_PATCHSET_REVISION` - SHA revision of the patchset
- `GERRIT_PROJECT` - Name of the Gerrit project
- `GERRIT_REFSPEC` - Git refspec for the change

## Prerequisites

This action requires:

1. A previous job that created and uploaded a `vpp-gerrit-vars` artifact
2. The workflow must be triggered by a `workflow_run` event
3. Access to `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` for artifact download

## Workflow Context

This action is typically used in workflows triggered by `workflow_run` events, where it needs to restore context from the original triggering workflow. The artifact contains files with the saved environment variable values.

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Process Gerrit Change
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Initial Gerrit Processing"]
    types:
      - completed

jobs:
  process-change:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Restore Gerrit Environment Variables
        uses: ./.github/actions/gerrit-env-vars-restore

      - name: Use Gerrit Variables
        run: |
          echo "Processing change: $GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER"
          echo "Branch: $GERRIT_BRANCH"
          echo "Project: $GERRIT_PROJECT"
```

## Error Handling

The action includes comprehensive error handling:

- Validates artifact existence before download
- Falls back to matrix artifacts (e.g., `vpp-gerrit-vars-*`) if the main artifact is not found
- Provides detailed debugging information about available artifacts
- Exits with error code if required files are not found

## Artifact Structure

The expected artifact (`vpp-gerrit-vars`) should contain the following files:

```
vpp-gerrit-vars/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-branch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-change-id
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-change-number
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-change-url
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-event-type
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-patchset-number
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-patchset-revision
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-project
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gerrit-refspec
```

Each file contains the corresponding environment variable value as plain text.

## Security Considerations

- Uses `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub API access
- Only accesses artifacts from the same repository
- Sanitizes input by removing newlines and carriage returns from restored values

## Troubleshooting

If the action fails:

1. Check that the triggering workflow successfully created the `vpp-gerrit-vars` artifact
2. Verify the workflow is triggered by a `workflow_run` event
3. Ensure `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` has appropriate permissions
4. Check the action logs for detailed artifact information

The action provides extensive logging to help diagnose issues with artifact discovery and download.
